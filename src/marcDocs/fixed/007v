    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>a - Beta (1/2 in., videocassette)</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Used for the home video system introduced in 1975 by Sony
        for home videorecording and playback on 1/2 inch
        videotape. It is distinguished by the size of the
        cassette, its <em>U-load</em> tape threading, and
        technical capabilities. This format is also known as
        <em>Betamax</em>.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>b - VHS (1/2 in., videocassette)</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Used for the home video system introduced in 1977 by
        Japan Victor Corporation (JVC) for home videorecording
        and playback on 1/2 inch videotape. It is distinguished
        by the size of the cassette, its <em>M-load</em> tape
        threading, and technical capabilities. VHS stands for
        "Video Home System."
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>c - U-matic (3/4 in., videocasstte)</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Used for a video format using Sony's trademark name which
        refers to its tape threading path in a U-shape. It is the
        worldwide standard for 3/4 inch videotape and is used
        extensively in industrial and broadcast production. Like
        the two 1/2 in. home video formats, it uses a helical
        scan recording system. It is also known as <em>U type
        standard</em>.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>d - EIAJ (1/2 in., reel)</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Used for the standard 1/2 inch reel-to-reel helical scan
        videotape system named for the Electronics Industries
        Association of Japan which set the standards for 1/2 in.
        video tape recorders manufactured since 1969. Referred to
        as "the old trailblazer."
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>e - Type C (1 in., reel)</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Used for the 1 inch videotape recording system utilizing
        one video head and tape runs at 9.61 inches per second.
        Type B system uses 2 heads and runs at 9.65 ips; Type A
        is an obsolete early system. Type B is still used in the
        U.S. and overseas (as of 1982), but Type C is the 1 inch
        format most widely employed as the broadcasting standard
        in the U.S. and overseas. Type C equipment and technology
        are made by Sony, RCA, and others.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>f - Quadruplex (1 in. or 2 in., reel)</strong>

      <div class="description">
        As opposed to the helical scan system, which uses one
        head, the Quadruplex videorecording system uses four
        videorecording heads. Often referred to as Quad, it was
        developed by Ampex in the mid-1950's. It provided higher
        quality resolution and color than did helical scanning.
        Quadruplex was the broadcast standard until recently,
        when less expensive helical scan systems have begun to
        overtake it. When describing a 2 inch videoreel that is
        not Quadruplex, use the code z (Other).
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>g - Laserdisc</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Laser optical (reflective) videorecording system that
        uses an analog technique called PWM (Pulse Width
        Modulation) to represent video information on a
        grooveless, smooth, round plastic disc. The disc is read
        (played back) by a weak laser beam that registers data
        appearing on the disc as tiny pits or depressions of
        varying lengths. Laserdiscs exist in three standard
        commercially produced sizes: 12, 8, and 4 3/4 inch. The
        12 inch disc is the most common size and is typically
        used for movies; the disc or its packaging usually bears
        an LD trademark (the phrase "LASER DISC" or "Laser
        Vision" usually appears as the lower part of that LD
        trademark); alternatively, LASER VIDEODISC, DiscoVision,
        LaserDisc, LaserVision, or a similar phrase may appear
        instead of the LD trademark. The 8 and 4 3/4 inch discs
        are uncommon and typically used for music videos or other
        short video programs; the disc or its packaging usually
        bears one of these terms or trademarks: CDV (CD VIDEO),
        VSD (VIDEO SINGLE DISC), or LD (LASER DISC). This system
        started commercial use in 1978, but production declined
        rapidly after 1998 due to the success of the DVD format.

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>h - CED (Capacitance Electronic Disc)
      videodisc</strong>

      <div class="description">
        CED videorecording system based on a plastic disc,
        usually 12 in. in diameter, on which visual information
        is recorded as deep pits in the bottom of the grooves.
        This visual information is read by a needle-in-the-groove
        type of electronic stylus that translates variance in
        capacitance into a video and audio signal. The CED disc
        is characteristically housed in a protective jacket. In
        1984, the manufacturer of CED players, RCA, announced its
        decision to cease production of the "RCA Selectavision"
        players.

        Betacam SP videorecording format, a professional analog
        format using component coding recorded on 1/2 inch metal
        tape, housed in a cassette. It is designed to yield a
        higher grade recording than the regular Betacam format,
        providing improved video quality and a better audio
        signal-to-noise ratio. There are two analog video tracks
        plus two FM (CD quality) audio tracks.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="charactervalue">
      <strong>k - Super-VHS (1/2 in., videocassette)</strong>

      <div class="description">
        Super-VHS format, which was originally designed for the
        consumer market to encode analog signals using a helical
        scan on 1/2 inch ferric-oxide tape, housed in a standard
        cassette. It has gained acceptance professionally in the
        broadcast industry and is now considered a professional
        format. Super-VHS format machines encode 400 lines of
        horizontal resolution and can play back videotapes
        recorded on regular VHS machines. Super-VHS requires
        high-grade tape and a high-resolution monitor equipped
        with separate Y/C (Luminance/Chrominance) video inputs.
        Super-VHS-C is the same video format but uses a special
        compact mini-cassette (often used with hand-held video
        cameras). These mini-cassettes can be used with standard
        VHS recorders by means of a special adapter cassette into
        which the mini-cassette is inserted.

        M-II videorecording format, a professional analog format
        using 1/2 inch metallic tape, housed in a cassette. It
        was developed by Panasonic as an alternative to the
        Betacam format developed by Sony.

      <strong>o - D-2 (3/4 in., videocassette)</strong>

      <div class="description">
        D-2 videorecording format, a professional digital
        videorecording format using composite coding on 3/4 inch
        metal particle tape, housed in a cassette. The digital
        encoding allows for multi-generation signal transfer
        (copying or dubbing) without signal degradation.
        Duplicate recordings are effectively identical to the
        original master. There are four independently editable
        PCM audio channels, offering a dynamic range of more than
        90 db (decibels). Additionally, it has separate tracks
        for an analog audio cue and time code.

      <div class="description">
        Laser optical (reflective) videorecording system that

        Modulation) to represent video information on a

        (played back) by a weak laser beam that registers data
        appearing on the disc as tiny pits or depressions of
        uniform length. DVDs are usually 4 3/4 inch in diameter
        (but a smaller 3 inch diameter disc may be produced
        commercially in some cases) and the disc or its packaging
        usually bear the term or trademark: DVD, DVD VIDEO, or
        VIDEO CD (in this case, the trademark is the standard one
