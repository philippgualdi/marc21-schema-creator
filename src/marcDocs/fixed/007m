        Nonanamorphic wide-screen process is primarily associated

        frame height, which is expanded by projection on a wide

        through the use of two projectors which superimpose two
        images of the film on the screen (usually a wide screen).
        It is usually associated with 35 mm. film. Polarized

        horizontally. It is then expanded to the correct
        proportions by projection on a wide screen with the use
        of special lenses that give greater magnification
        laterally than vertically. Introduced and adopted for
        commercial use in 1953 under the name of Cinemascope,
        followed by Techniscope (1963), Naturama, Panavision,
        etc. Also used for 16 mm. film which employs this

        other formats that achieve a wide-screen effect though
        the use of simultaneous projection of separate prints on
        very large, sometimes deeply curved screens through the
        use of multiprojectors that build up the projected

        the width of the space between the perforation holes of
        the frame.

      <div class="description2 description">
        Standard format for silent film from about 1899 until the
        late 1920's when sound film was introduced and the frame

        None of the other codes is appropriate. An example of
        this is the 70 mm. Imax format which is a
        non-rectangular, circular 180 degree limited use format
        that is not standardized. Imax may not technically be
        considered a wide-screen format because it does not have
        an aspect ratio, but it does achieve a wide-screen
        effect.

      <div class="description">
        Color system in which three color-separation negatives
        were produced on black-and-white film. 3 strip color is
        often used synonymously with the trademark Technicolor.
        In the Technicolor three-component system, light
        reflected from the subject matter is transmitted through
        the single lens of a special camera where it strikes a
        prism. One part of the light is passed through the prism
        and a green filter to produce a green record. The
        remainder of the light is reflected from the prism and
        absorbed by negatives to produce red and blue records.
        Each of the negatives is developed to produce new
        negatives which resemble black-and-white negatives.

        Color system in which two strips of film, one to record

        front piece of film. These two strips of negatives were
        then used to produce prints of duplitized film stock
        (film stock with emulsion on both sides of the base),
        with a red-dyed image on one side, and a blue-dyed or
        -toned image on the other. Although extensively used in
        early color film processes, the inherent inability of two

        rendered all such systems obsolete when three-color

    <h3>INPUT CONVENTIONS</h3>

    <div class="description2">
      <strong>Field length</strong> - Field 007 for the category
      of material <strong>motion picture</strong> currently has
      23 character positions defined for it. The first eight
      positions (007/00-07) should always be used. An institution
      may choose additionally to code positions following 007/07
      up to and including 007/22. Because the definitions of the
      codes in field 007 are dependent upon the character
      position in which they occur, the coding of any character
      position following 007/07 mandates that each preceding
      character position contains a code or fill character (|).
